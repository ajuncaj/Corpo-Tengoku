Corpo-Tengoku: A rhythm game by Alex Juncaj

You've just been hired at a new job! How exciting! Too bad you can't figure out what it is you do here...

Corpo-Tengoku is a rhythm game created in Python using the Pygame library, heavily inspired by the Rythm Heaven series of games. It consists of a number of short, self contained set-pieces of often bizzare senarios involving some sort of rhythm-based gameplay. These are eventually put together in "remixes" that switch between the mini-games in time with the music.

This project is a wonderful showcase of Object Oriented Programming, using the Event-loop, the use of unfamilar libraries, and general python skills. 

My self-imposed challenge for this project was to create a quality, complete game experience from scratch without ever having done so and without a pre-built engine such as Unity. This includes:
- Gameplay
- Expandable/Reusable/"Good" code structure
- Art and Animation
- UI design and Implementation
